create a micro-server using nodejs express sqlite3
micro-server should:

1. handle requests to its '/message' endpoint 2. handle requests to its '/messages' endpoint. 3. the server should have a sqlite3 database integration. 4. when a request is made to the '/message' endpoint the micro server should add the body of the message http request to the sqlite3 database. 5. the database should have a table called 'messages' with two columns; 'id' and 'body'. 6. the 'id' should be a human-readable id generated by the micro server. 7. the micro server should handle the '/messages' request by returning the bodies of the messages in the sqlite3 database messages table. 8. i want a bash script to start and stop the server easily. 9. I want the bash cript to work in a containerized setting. 10. i want the bash script to be able to list all currently running micro-servers. 11. I want each micro-server to support multiple listeners at different ports. 12. each listener will be a micro-server + db service. 12b. in this way one container will be able to support multiple micro-servers at one http endpoint serving multiple ports.
